\chapter{Expander graphs}
\label{mathchapter}

Graphs appear everywhere in mathematics but they are especially common in 
combinatorics. 

\begin{definition}
(Graph) A graph is an ordered pair $G=(V,E)$. The elements of $V$ are called 
vertices. The elements of $E$ are 2-element subsets of $V$ and they are called 
the edges of the graph. 
\end{definition}

The main objects of study in this work are polytopes. They are interesting 
objects in their own right but also play an important role in e.g. 
optimization. In the following section we introduces the basics of polytopes. 
More in-depth knowledge can be found in Ziegler's book [citation]. 

\begin{definition}
(Polytope) A polytope is the convex hull of a finite number of points in 
$\mathbb{R}^d$, that is 
\begin{equation}
 P = \left\{x \middle| x = \sum_{i=1}^{|V|} \lambda_i v_i, 0\leq \lambda_i 
\leq 1, \sum_{i=1}^{|V|} \lambda_i = 1 \right\}
\end{equation}

\end{definition}



\section{The End}
\label{sec:end}

Finally, this is the end.  The bibliography starts on
the next page.
Note how the \verb2\hyperref2 package
(mentioned in chapter \ref{introchap})
also makes hyperlinks from references
(e.g., Mulick\cite{mulick})
to entries in the bibliography.
